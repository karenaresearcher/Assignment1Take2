Introduction

My name is Karen Alexander and I am a fourth year student in the QQPM program of Educational Psychology. QQPM stands for Quantitative, Qualitative and Psychometric Methods. Prior to coming to UNL I worked in K-12 education as a teacher and school principal. I love young people, especially teenagers. 

I was always interested in math as my undergraduate degree was in math and music education. While working in schools I became more ans more interested in the types of measures used in education and I also began to question the methods used to measure students, teachers, schools, etc. That is what drove me to pursue my PhD.

Hopefully I will be able to complete my doctorate and become a professor so that I can continue to pursue my research in education. I am particularly interested in how we measure effects of teachers on students, students on students, and students on teachers as I see the classroom as a dynamic system. In addition, I am interested in how we determine school effectiveness. 

I have used R. SAS, flexMIRT, SPSS, MPlus, and MAXQDA for statistical analysis. However, I do not feel competent in any of them. I did do computer programming many years ago in FORTRAN. All to say, that is not very useful today (although there are a few statistical programs that use FORTRAN).
